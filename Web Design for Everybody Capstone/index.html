				<h2>About Me</h2>
				Heya Folks!!!
				<p>I am a girl who's been born and brought up in the beautiful state of Sikkim, India. I have done my schooling from Holy Cross School, Tadong and I must say I enjoyed my school life a lot. I am also a Wildlife Enthusiast and I absolutely love and adore animals.</p>
				<p>I am currently a B-Tech 3rd year student, pursuing <abbr title="Computer Science &amp; Engineering">CSE</abbr>. I am skilled in C, C++, &amp; Java and have the basic understanding and knowledge of Data Structure, DAA, Python, MySQL and PL/SQL. Honestly, I still am not sure as to what my field of interest (as an engineer) is or what subject/topic I wish to follow for my future.</p>
				<div class="parallax"></div> 
				<p>If you ask me I am quite a happy go lucky, cheerful person. Since I was a kid I have always loved to dance, its one of my hobbies, including swimming and reading.I immensely enjoyed reading murder mysteries (Hands down Agatha Christe was the best) and fantasy novels: still waiting for my Hogwarts letter or perhaps a magical wardrobe that would lead me to Narnia.</p>
				<details open><summary>My favourite books</summary>
					<ul>
						<li>Malory Towers &amp; St Claire's</li>
						<li>Harry Potter Series</li>
						<li>Eragon Series</li>
						<li>A Thousand Splendid Suns</li>
					</ul>
					</details>
					I havent read anything new since my college started, which is sad, but I will surely latch onto a new story soon:).
