				<h2>Summer Internship</h2>
				<p>I was a 2 week summer intern in this Wildlife Hospital/NGO called <abbr title="People for Animals">PFA</abbr>, Bangalore. I was part of the rescue and rehabilitation team and spent most of my time in the ICU caring, feeding and nurturing the urban wild animals. I used to deal with Macaques, squirrels, bats and many birds ranging from nestling to adults. I also gave a presentation regarding "Release Protocols to be followed for Wildlife".</p>

				<h2>Mountaineering</h2>
				<p>I enjoy trekking and camping quite a lot, so I went for two mountaineering courses from <abbr title="Himalayan  Mountaineering Institute">HMI</abbr>. A 15-days Adventure Course in the 2014 and a 28-days Basic Course in 2015. Those were probably the best days of my life. The Adventure Course was had all the fun activities, but it was during my Basic-Course that I learned some really cool techniques about rock &amp; ice climbing </p>

				<h2>Adventure Activities</h2>
				<p>I have already talked about my love for trekkings, but I have also done Bungy jumping, Rappelling, Scuba Diving, Para Gliding and Para sailing. For now, I am dying to cut off Sky Diving, Skiing and surfing. from my bucket list. I hope my life to be forever this adventurous.</p>
